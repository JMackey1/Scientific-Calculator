                    Scientific Calculator is a Windows calculator program
                    that does many of the typical scientific calculator
                    functions you would expect: trigonometry functions,
                    exponentiation, roots, and more.
                </p>

                    While the calculator has buttons for all of the main
                    functions, it is designed for quick and easy keyboard
                    use as well.<br><br>

                    You can scroll through the sections to read about
                    all of the functionality of the calculator, or use
                    the navigation panel on the left to jump to a given
                    section.

                    The equal button will compute the answer for the
                    current expression. The
                    answer, as well as the expression, will be displayed
                    in the history and the current expression will be cleared.
                    <br>

                    <h3>Operators (/, *, -, +, ^, %, !, &radic;)</h3>
                    <p>
                    The operator buttons will enter the corresponding operator

                    <h3>e</h3>
                    <p>
                    The e button will enter e into the current expression.<br>
                    <br><strong>Note:</strong> This is Euler's number (2.71828).<br>
                    </p>

                    <h3>log</h3>
                    The log button will enter log( 
                    into the current expression. This is log base 10.<br>

                    <h3>ln</h3>
                    The ln button will enter ln( into
                    the current expression. This is the natural log (base e).<br>

                    <h3>floor</h3>
                    The floor button will enter
                    floor( into the current expression. This rounds a result down.

                    <h3>sin</h3>
                    The sin button will enter sin(
                    into the current expression. Trigonometry sine.<br>

                    <h3>cos</h3>
                    The cos button will enter cos( 
                    into the current expression. Trigonometry cosine.<br>

                    <h3>tan</h3>
                    The tan button will enter tan( 
                    into the current expression. Trigonometry tangent.<br>

                    <h3>asin</h3>
                    The asin button will enter asin(

                    The atan button will enter atan( 
                    into the current expression. Trigonometry arc tangent.<br>

                    <h3>ans</h3>
                    The ans button will enter ans
                    into the current expression. This represents the previous
                    answer computed.
                </p>

                <h1 id="keyboard">Keyboard Controls</h1>
                <p>
                    Not all keys on the keyboard will enter something into
                    the current expression. This is largely to prevent adding junk
                    to the expression that will not make it through the
                    evaluation process.<br><br>
                    
                    Instead of clicking on the "sin" button, you can type
                    the keys "s", "i", "n" and "(" to find the sine of the
                    entered expression.<br><br>

                    The general idea is that your keyboard will enter
                    into the current expression what you expect it to. If you hold
                    shift and press "1", you will add "!" to the current expression.
                    If you press "*" on the numpad, you will add "*" to the
                    current expression. The notable exception to this is the P key,
                    which enters &pi;, and the arrow keys, which have special
                    behavior.<br><br>

                    Below are the keys and what they
                    enter into the current expression.<br><br>

                    <h3>Letters</h3>
                    <p>
                    Any letter that is part of a
                    function name will be recognized and added into the
                    current expression. See <a href="#functions">Function Behavior
                        and Examples</a> for a list of functions.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Numbers</h3>
                    Both the normal number keys
                    and the numpad number keys will enter the corresponding
                    number into the current expression.<br><br>

                    <h3>P</h3>
                    This will enter the &pi; symbol
                    into the current expression.<br><br>

                    <h3>e</h3>
                     E will enter e into the current expression.
                    Used in some functions, scientific notation and as Euler's
                    number.<br><br>

                    <h3>Return/Enter</h3>
                    The return and numpad enter keys 
                    will try to find the answer to the current expression.
                    <br><br>

                    <h3>.</h3>
                    The period/decimal key will enter a
                    period/decimal into the current expression.<br><br>

                    <h3>Numpad Operators (/, *, -, +)</h3>
                     The numpad
                    operator keys will enter the corresponding operator into
                    the current expression.<br><br>

                    <h3>Shift+Keys</h3>
                     Holding left or right shift
                    and pressing a regular key will enter the alternatvie
                    key symbol into the current expression. Example: Shift+6 will
                    add "^" to the current expression.<br><br>

                    <h3>Backspace</h3>
                     Backspace will delete a single
                    character from the current expression at its current cursor position.
                    <br><br>

                    <h3>Space</h3>
                     Space will add a space to the input
                    view. Spaces are ignored by the parser and can be used to
                    make an expression easier to read.<br><br>

                    <h3>Up Arrow (&uparrow;)</h3>
                    The up arrow (&uparrow;) will
                    go back through the history and enter the previous result
                    into the current expression. This removes anything in the 
                    current expression.<br><br>

                    <h3>Down Arrow (&downarrow;)</h3>
                    The down arrow
                    (&downarrow;) will go forward through the history and enter
                    the previous result into the current expression. This removes anything 
                    in the current expression.<br><br>

                    <h3>Left/Right Arrow (&leftarrow;/&rightarrow;)</h3>
                     The left and right arrows (&leftarrow;/&rightarrow;)
                    will move the cursor position in the current expression to the
                    left or right. This can be used to input or remove a character
                    at a specific position.<br><br>

                    <h3>Ctrl+V</h3>
                    <p>You can copy and paste anything you want
                    to the current expression by using Ctrl+V.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Note:</strong> This
                    allows you to enter junk into the current expression.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <h3>F1</h3>
                    The F1 key will open the help window (this
                    document).
                </p>

                <h1 id="current-expression">Current Expression</h1>
                <p>
                    The current expression area shows the expression that
                    is currently being entered. This is the expression that will be
                    evaluated upon pressing return/enter or the "=" button. The image
                    below shows an example of a complex expression:<br><br>
                </p>

                    <img src="images/scientificCalculatorInputAndHistory.png"
                    alt="Calculator UI with input">
                    <p style="align-self: center;"><i>The current expression is: sin(cos(3+2))*1.34e+20</i></p>
                <p>
                    The expression is not evaulated in pieces. That is, you can enter
                    a complete expression without it being evaluated after every operator
                    like some calculators do.<br><br>

                    You can use the mouse or arrow keys to move the cursor position and
                    enter characters somewhere other than the end of the expression. For
                    example, if you wanted to change the (3+2) term inside the cos function,
                    you could press the left arrow key until the cursor is in front of the
                    "2" and then press backspace to remove 3+2. Finally, you enter the new
                    expression to use with the keyboard or buttons. Alternatively, you could
                    use the mouse and click on the position in front of the "2" to set the
                    cursor there.<br><br>

                    When entering characters to the expression in this way, the character
                    will be inserted at the cursor position and the cursor position will be
                    set to after the newly entered character.<br><br>

                    For very long expressions, this view becomes scrollable vertically.
                </p>
                
                <h1 id="history">History</h1>
                <p>
                    The history area shows the previously entered expressions
                    and their results (or error messages). Entries are shown with the
                    most recent expression at the top (near the word "History") and
                    older expressions at the bottom. When there are too many entries
                    to fit in the view, the view becomes scrollable vertically.<br><br>
                </p>

                <img src="images/scientificCalculatorSimpleHistory.png"
                alt="Simple history view">

                <p>
                    In this example, the last expression entered was "sin(0)". The
                    first expression entered was "2+2". If you want to use a previous
                    expression for anything, you can navigate through the history using
                    the up/down arrow keys (&uparrow;/&downarrow;). This can be used to break
                    an expression into parts and see the individual component values,
                    correct an input error or re-evaluate an expression using different
                    terms.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Note: </strong> Accessing the history in this
                    way will remove anything currently entered in the current expression.
                    This cannot be used to enter a previous expression into a new
                    expression. If you would like to do this, you can select the item
                    in the history view with the mouse and then use Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V
                    to copy and paste something into the expression.<br><br>

                    The history view will contain all expressions previously entered.
                    However, the up/down arrow keys (&uparrow;/&downarrow;) will only cycle
                    through the last 50 expressions.
                </p>

                <h1 id="functions">Function Behavior and Examples</h1>
                <p>
                    This section goes over the functions that are available in the
                    calculator, including their syntax and what they do. Functions
                    can be used like operators (i.e. you can multiply by them) and
                    you can create complex expressions using compound functions 
                    (such as sin(cos(0))).<br><br>

                    <strong>Note:</strong> Parentheses are not required for functions;
                    sin(5) is the same as sin5. However, it is strongly recommended
                    that you enclose a function's expression with parentheses to make
                    it easier to read.<br><br>

                    <h3>Roots (square, cube, etc.)</h3>

                        While technically not a function, roots bear special mention.
                        Roots are products of fractional exponents. As such, when you
                        want to find the root of an expression you need to raise that
                        expression to a fractional power. 1/2 is the square root of a
                        number, 1/3 is the cube root of a number, and so on.

                        You can use the keyword "ans" to use the previous expression's
                        answer as input to a new expression. In this example, the first
                        expression computed was 2*2*3, which equals 12.<br><br>

                        For the second expression, ans was used to find the square of
                        the previous expression. This was done by multiplying ans by
                        itself.<br><br>

                    <p>
                        The calculator allows you to enter a number in scientific
                        notation. Scientific notation is defined as: exactly 1 non-zero
                        integer, a period, any number of integers, the letter E (upper or
                        lower case), a plus or minus sign (&plus;/&minus;) and an integer
                        representing how many powers of ten to multiply the number by.
                        <br><br>

                        In this example, we use the "+" symbol to make the number larger
                        (1.2345 * 10^4). By using the "-" symbol, we can make a number smaller.
                        For example, "12345E-4" would evaluate as "12345 * 10^(-4)", or
                        1.2345.
